## Project Name & Pitch

#### Mm Mm Mm!
An application created in React and Redux to search for and keep track of recipes. Scans upc codes and will eventually make recipe suggestions based on what is going bad.
Client: Anyone who cooks and wants to cut down on food waste.

## Project Status
Project is complete according to spec. Eventually I would like to pull in info on shelf life of ingredients and make recipe suggestions based on this.

#### Project Pitch
    - Ideally, by the end of this project one will be able to search for ingredients they want to use and get back best matches.
